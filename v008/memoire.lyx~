Workflow definition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Workflow is defined by Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC), which is a
 consortium formed to define standards for the interoperability of workflow
 management systems, as following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Workflow is the sequence of tasks, steps, and decisions that need to be
 followed to complete a specific process.
 It can be thought of as a set of instructions that describe how a process
 should be performed, including the order in which tasks are to be completed,
 who is responsible for performing each task, and what should happen next
 based on the outcome of each task.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Workflows can be used to automate a wide range of business processes, such
 as invoicing, order fulfillment, human resources, and project management.
 The goal of a workflow is to make sure that tasks are completed in the
 correct order and by the right people, and to ensure that the process is
 efficient and accurate.

Definition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Workflow management system (WMS) was defined by WfMC 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WfMC_glossary"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 as a software application that is designed to help organizations automate
 and manage their business processes.
 A WMS allows an organization to define and implement a workflow – a series
 of tasks, steps, and decisions – that need to be followed to complete a
 specific process.
 The system can then be used to track the progress of the workflow, manage
 the flow of information and documents, and ensure that tasks are completed
 in the correct order and by the right people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A WMS can be used to automate a wide range of business processes, such as
 invoicing, order fulfillment, human resources, and project management.
 It can also be used to integrate different systems, such as email, calendar,
 and customer relationship management (CRM) software.
 WMS allows you to streamline the process and make it more efficient, reduce
 errors and delays, and give you real-time visibility into the status of
 your processes, also it’s common to have a built-in reporting and analytics
 tools to measure the performance of the process.

Workflow engine architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The WfMC have published an architectural Reference Model WfRM which is a
 framework that provides a common understanding of the concepts and components
 that are involved in the design, execution, and management of workflows

There are 5 interfaces
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 which are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Interface 1 Web Service (process definition tools)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 1st interface service provides the link between the tools designed for
 creating and modifying workflow definitions and the workflow enactment
 service.
 It controls the system connection.
 In addition, it inquiries the workflow for process definitions and resource
 classifications.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Interface 2 (workflow client applications) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Through the 2nd interface service, users have access to a work list handler
 service and enactment services.
 In addition, the service produces states of cases and work items.
 The states are also controlled through this service (i.e.
 start, interruption, hang-up, executing, etc).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Interface 3 (invoked applications)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When some tasks of a process need to invoke an application outside of the
 workflow engine, they directly activate the workflow enactment service
 through the 3rd interface service and open interactive applications the
 current work item of the work list handler.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Interface 4 (other workflow enactment services)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interoperability and communication between workflows become the bottleneck
 to solve with the recommendations and standards of WfMC.
 The 4th interface service handles the basic operations to exchange between
 autonomous workflow systems.
 Through this interface, workflows transfer cases, resources and work items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Interface 5 (administration and monitoring tools)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 5th interface manages the administration and the monitoring tools of
 the workflow system.
 Through this service, the executing process should be managed, well-supervised
 and the events should be recorded in log files.

\begin_layout Standard
Scientific workflows are data-intensive applications representing distributed
 data sources and complex computations in various domains, i.e.
 astronomy, engineering sciences, and bioinformatics.
 In distributed environments like fog computing, various sensors and experimenta
l processes generate a large volume of data that need collection and processing
 within specific time constraints.

\begin_layout Standard
The life cycle for scientific workflows heavily distinguishes from other
 workflow types.
 The life cycle is inferred from observations about theway scientists create
 and conduct experiments and from known properties ofscientific simulations
 and computations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typically, there is only one user group, the scientists, playing the roles
 of a modeler, user, administrator,and analyst.
 The focus of their work is usually on single workflow instances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be precise, scientists do not distinguish between workflow models and
 instances or are not aware of a difference between models and instances,
 respectively.
 They setup a simulation and execute it once at a time.
 Because scientists typically develop their workflow in a trial-and-error
 manner, modeling and execution phases are not arranged in a strict sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In fact, they can be carried out alternated.
 An additional cycle therefore leads from execution back to modeling phase
 with the helpof a “suspend” operation on the workflow instance, which remains
 hidden fromthe scientists.
 Technical details are transparent for scientists altogether.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance, conventional workflow adaptation is experienced as scientific
 workflow modeling; the deployment (of parts of a workflow) is part of the
 “run/resume” operation , which is also hidden for the scientist.
 Workflow execution starts immediately after modeling.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The traditional execution and monitoring phases aremerged into a single
 phase in the scien tific workflow life cycle because from ascientist’s
 point of view monitoring only visualizes a running workflow (instance).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After execution a scientist can analyze the computed results and may remodel
 and reexecute the workflow possibly with different parameters.

\begin_layout Itemize
Business workflows aim at automating organizational processes that are mainly
 executed by humans, while scientific workflows aim at validating hypotheses
 of a researcher based on available data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Business workflows have a predetermined goal, while scientific workflows
 have experimental and exploratory goals that vary more frequently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Business workflows are executed under human control, while scientific workflows
 are executed fully automatically by a computer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Business workflows depend on certain resources including application programs,
 while scientific workflows depend more strongly on proper parameter settings

 of cloud computing identifies "five essential characteristics":
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
On-demand self-service
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server
 time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human
 interaction with each service provider.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Broad network access
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard
 mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms
 (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Resource pooling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers
 using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources
 dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.
 There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally
 has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources
 but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g.,
 country, state, or datacenter).
 Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, and network
 bandwidth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Rapid elasticity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases
 automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand.
 To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear
 to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Measured service
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging
 a metering capability1 at some level of abstraction appropriate to the
 type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts).
 Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparen
cy for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Service Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has define 3 services

, which are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Software as a Service (SaaS)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider’s applications
 running on a cloud infrastructure2 .
 The applications are accessible from various client devices through either
 a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or
 a program interface.
 The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure
 including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual
 application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited userspecific
 application configuration settings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Platform as a Service (PaaS)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructu
re consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages
, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider.3 The consumer
 does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including
 network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the
 deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-h
osting environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage,
 networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer
 is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating
 systems and applications.
 The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure
 but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications;
 and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host
 firewalls).

\begin_layout Paragraph
Private cloud
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organizati
on comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units).
 It may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party,
 or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Community cloud
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific
 community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g.,
 mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations).
 It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations
 in the community, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may
 exist on or off premises.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Public cloud
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public.
 It may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government
 organization, or some combination of them.
 It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Hybrid cloud
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud
 infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities,
 but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables
 data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing
 between clouds).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Multi-Cloud Computing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multi-Cloud = Any Combination of Native Public Clouds and Private Clouds
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some companies can’t use a single public cloud.
 Their developers may like Google Cloud, while IT operates in Azure both
 on-premise and in the cloud.
 Meanwhile, a startup they just acquired runs their killer app in Amazon
 Web Services (AWS).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the multi-cloud model.
 It’s the ultimate in flexibility to choose the cloud that best fits the
 application or business need.
 It’s no wonder organizations overwhelming go the multi-cloud route, often
 with the inclusion of hybrid cloud.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main advantage of this model comparing to the public model is avoiding

\begin_layout Standard
The document 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 list essential features to enable services that truly represent the cloud-compu
ting model and satisfy expectations of consumers, and cloud offerings must
 be having following features: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Self-service
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consumers of cloud computing services expect on-demand, nearly instant access
 to resources.
 To support this expectation, clouds must allow self-service access so that
 customers can request, customize, pay, and use services without intervention
 of human operators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Per-usage metered and billed 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cloud computing eliminates up-front commitment by users, allowing them to
 request and use only the necessary amount.
 Services must be priced on a shortterm basis (e.g., by the hour), allowing
 users to release (and not pay for) resources as soon as they are not needed.
 For these reasons, clouds must implement features to allow efficient trading
 of service such as pricing, accounting, and billing.
 Metering should be done accordingly for different types of service (e.g.,
 storage, processing, and bandwidth) and usage promptly reported, thus providing
 greater transparency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Elastic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cloud computing gives the illusion of infinite computing resources available
 on demand.
 Therefore, users expect clouds to rapidly provide resources in any quantity
 at any time.
 In particular, it is expected that the additional resources can be (a)
 provisioned, possibly automatically, when an application load increases
 and (b) released when load decreases (scale up and down).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Customizable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a multi-tenant cloud a great disparity between user needs is often the
 case.
 Thus, resources rented from the cloud must be highly customizable.
 In the case of infrastructure services, customization means allowing users
 to deploy specialized virtual appliances and to be given privileged (root)
 access to the virtual servers.
 Other service classes (PaaS and SaaS) offer less flexibility and are not
 suitable for general-purpose computing, but still are expected to provide
 a certain level of customization.

Scalability
\series default
: We can increase or decrease the requirement of resources according to
 the business requirements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Cost
\series default
: Cloud Computing requires significantly lesser capital expenditures to
 get up and running, it reduces the huge capital costs of buying hardware
 and software.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Speed
\series default
: resources can be accessed in minutes, typically within a few clicks ,no
 more waiting months or years and spending millions of dollars before anyone
 gets to log into your new solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Productivity
\series default
: Cloud computing technology allows on-the-fly, point-and-click customization
 and report generation for business users, so IT doesn’t spend significant
 time on such tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
SLA-driven
\series default
: The system is dynamically managed by service-level agreements that define
 policies such as how quickly responses to requests need to be delivered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Multi-tenancy
\series default
: The system is built in a way that allows several customers to share infrastruc
ture with mutual opacity and without compromising privacy and security.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Service-oriented
\series default
: The system allows composing applications out of discrete, re-usable, loosely-c
oupled services.
 Changes to, or failure of, a service will not disrupt other services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Virtualized
\series default
: Applications are decoupled from the underlying hardware.
 An application may rely on Grid Computing and multiple applications could
 run on a single computer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Data, Data, Data

\begin_layout Paragraph
Cloud Vulnerability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary challenge posed to data management in the cloud is content security.
 Due to the ease of access to content over the internet, concerns have been
 raised due to data vulnerability.
 In a review of cloud security issues, funded by IBM, 382 organisations
 disclosed cloud security issues in 2016 across 16 different industries.
 The security issues faced by cloud environments include; the mis-use of
 cloud content, malicious hacking, failure of vendor security and shared
 technology vulnerabilities.
 While improve cloud security is an area currently undergoing considerable
 research , and it was observed that the security of cloud content is vulnerable
 on several levels.
 On a "communications level" risk arises from the sharing of sensitive informati
on (e.g.
 access passwords).
 On a "security level" the cloud is vulnerable to password cracking, cookie
 poisoning and CAPTCHA breaking among other threats.
 Moreover, cloud content is subject to Service Level Agreements (SLAs) such
 as legal or confidentiality requirements which may compromise data security.
 Due to the multi-tiered vulnerability of cloud architecture, current innovation
s aiming to improve cloud security are unlikely to remove all levels of
 threat.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Technical Issues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although Cloud Computing offers improved efficiency by means of “on demand”
 content access, the cloud can also be prone to technical malfunctions such
 as outages.
 Even the most established cloud vendors do encounter unexpected technical
 problems despite generally having high standards of maintenance.It is estimated
 that cloud services are unavailable for 7.5 hours per year (99.9% reliability).
 While, at a glance, this figure may seem impressive, it does not reach
 the expected reliability quotient of 99.999% for sensitive data management.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Cost Creep 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At first glance migrating to a “pay-as-you-go” pricing model as employed
 by many cloud providers may seem financially attractive.
 However, it has been well documented that organisations that migrate to
 a cloud environment are often charged with additional hidden usage charges.
 Additional usage charge can accumulate to be a deterrent to cloud adoption,
 particularly for smaller enterprises.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Financial Risk in Disaster Scenarios
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cloud users can incur significant costs in cases of cloud outage, security
 breach or vendor lock-in (see below).
 According to the Penomen Institute, for example, in 2016, the average distribut
ed cost incurred by a data centre outage was almost $750, 000.
 In the same year data breaches, depending on their nature, are estimated
 to have cost between around 130$ and 170$ to resolve per record.
 The cost in these scenarios may fall on either the cloud utiliser or the
 cloud vendor, depending on the pre-defined contract between the two parties.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Vendor Lock-In
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vendor lock-in problem in cloud computing is characterized by expensive
 and time-consuming migration of application and data to alternative providers.
 Cloud software vendors lock in customers in several ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
by designing a system incompatible with software developed by other vendors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
by using proprietary standards or closed architectures that lack interoperabilit
y with other applications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
by licensing the software under exclusive conditions.

Description and main features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WorkflowSim was introduced for modeling Scientific Workflows in cloud environmen
t.
 Workflows in heterogeneous distributed systems show different levels of
 overheads that are explained based on computational operations and miscellaneou
s works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of simulators such as CloudSim do not consider fine granularity simulations
 of workflows and task clustering.
 Task clustering reduces the number of jobs to be executed and so execution
 overhead is decreased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, a job may have high risk for suffering from failures since it
 consists of several tasks.
 Researchers with WorkflowSim can study the impact of job failures runtime
 performance of workflows for different clustering methods.

\begin_layout Standard
WorkflowSim has many advantages
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 which are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It supports a stack of workflow parser and workflow engine delay to workflow
 optimization techniques with better accuracy are implemented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It implements several workflow-scheduling methods such as HEFT, Min-Min,
 and Max-Min and so developers can compare their algorithms with them in
 a simple way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It considers task clustering and layered overhead to the workflow simulation.
 Therefore, developers can test various strategies based on a real trace
 of overheads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It models failures for two layers (i.e., task/job) by an interface and hence
 developers can design fault-tolerant techniques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Limitations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WorkflowSim has some limitations such as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It includes limited types of failures.
 Therefore, developers cannot simulate the situation when a task is not
 successfully sent due to network problems or workflow scheduler issues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It does not consider the performance characteristic of file I/O.
 Therefore, developers cannot obtain suitable simulation for data-intensive
 applications since these applications involve reading or writing huge data
 files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It supports only simple workflow techniques and so developers cannot use
 other important approaches like workflow partitioning in their implementations.
