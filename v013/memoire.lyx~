Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Workflows are a systematic way of describing and executing a series of computati
onal or data manipulation steps, or tasks, in a specific application domain.
 Workflow technology is established in the business domain for several years.
 This fact suggests the need for detailed investigations in the qualification
 of conventional workflow technology for the evolving application domain
 of e-Science.

Scientific workflows are a specialized form of workflows that are designed
 for data-intensive or knowledge discovery applications in various scientific
 disciplines.
 Scientific workflows enable researchers to formulate, share, reuse, and
 validate complex methods that involve multiple data sources and computational
 platforms.

There are many scientific applications in various fields, such as astronomy
 and biology that contain a large amount of data and involve a large number
 of tasks.
 These applications are represented by a workflow that represents a set
 of data processing steps.

Workflow definition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Workflow is defined by Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC), which is a
 consortium formed to define standards for the interoperability of workflow
 management systems, as following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Workflow is the sequence of tasks, steps, and decisions that need to be
 followed to complete a specific process.
 It can be thought of as a set of instructions that describe how a process
 should be performed, including the order in which tasks are to be completed,
 who is responsible for performing each task, and what should happen next
 based on the outcome of each task.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Workflows can be used to automate a wide range of business processes, such
 as invoicing, order fulfillment, human resources, and project management.
 The goal of a workflow is to make sure that tasks are completed in the
 correct order and by the right people, and to ensure that the process is
 efficient and accurate.

\begin_layout Standard
Scientific workflows are data-intensive applications representing distributed
 data sources and complex computations in various domains, i.e.
 astronomy, engineering sciences, and bioinformatics.
 In distributed environments like fog computing, various sensors and experimenta
l processes generate a large volume of data that need collection and processing
 within specific time constraints.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The life cycle for scientific workflows heavily distinguishes from other
 workflow types.
 The life cycle is inferred from observations about theway scientists create
 and conduct experiments and from known properties ofscientific simulations
 and computations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typically, there is only one user group, the scientists, playing the roles
 of a modeler, user, administrator,and analyst.
 The focus of their work is usually on single workflow instances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be precise, scientists do not distinguish between workflow models and
 instances or are not aware of a difference between models and instances,
 respectively.
 They setup a simulation and execute it once at a time.
 Because scientists typically develop their workflow in a trial-and-error
 manner, modeling and execution phases are not arranged in a strict sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In fact, they can be carried out alternated.
 An additional cycle therefore leads from execution back to modeling phase
 with the helpof a “suspend” operation on the workflow instance, which remains
 hidden fromthe scientists.
 Technical details are transparent for scientists altogether.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance, conventional workflow adaptation is experienced as scientific
 workflow modeling; the deployment (of parts of a workflow) is part of the
 “run/resume” operation , which is also hidden for the scientist.
 Workflow execution starts immediately after modeling.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The traditional execution and monitoring phases aremerged into a single
 phase in the scien tific workflow life cycle because from ascientist’s
 point of view monitoring only visualizes a running workflow (instance).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After execution a scientist can analyze the computed results and may remodel
 and reexecute the workflow possibly with different parameters.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
workflows are able to deal with huge amounts of data, e.g.
 collected by sensors or calculated by scientific algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
workflows are capable of running in distributed and highly heterogeneous
 environments—a common scenario in scientific computations where a great
 variety of platforms and programming languages is usually employed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_inset

, we listed some of them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Business workflows aim at automating organizational processes that are mainly
 executed by humans, while scientific workflows aim at validating hypotheses
 of a researcher based on available data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Business workflows have a predetermined goal, while scientific workflows
 have experimental and exploratory goals that vary more frequently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Business workflows are executed under human control, while scientific workflows
 are executed fully automatically by a computer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Business workflows depend on certain resources including application programs,
 while scientific workflows depend more strongly on proper parameter settings

\begin_layout Standard
Every workflow is executed on a workflow management system (WMS).

 which was defined by WfMC 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 as following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A software application that is designed to help organizations automate and
 manage their business processes.
 A WMS allows an organization to define and implement a workflow – a series
 of tasks, steps, and decisions – that need to be followed to complete a
 specific process.
 The system can then be used to track the progress of the workflow, manage
 the flow of information and documents, and ensure that tasks are completed
 in the correct order and by the right people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A WMS can be used to automate a wide range of business processes, such as
 invoicing, order fulfillment, human resources, and project management.
 It can also be used to integrate different systems, such as email, calendar,
 and customer relationship management (CRM) software.
 WMS allows you to streamline the process and make it more efficient, reduce
 errors and delays, and give you real-time visibility into the status of
 your processes, also it’s common to have a built-in reporting and analytics
 tools to measure the performance of the process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Workflow engine architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
workflows are compositions of tasks (also referred to as activities) by
 means of causal or data dependencies that are carried out on a computer.
 They are executed on a workflow management system (WMS).
 A workflow that utilizes Web services (WSs) as implementations of tasks
 is usually called service composition.
 Web services are the most prominent implementation of the serviceoriented
 architecture (SOA).
 The Web Service technology is an approach to provide and request services
 in distributed environments independent of programming languages, platforms,
 and operating systems.
 It is applied in a very wide range of applications where integration of
 heterogeneous systems is a must.

There are 5 interfaces
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 which are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Interface 1 Web Service (process definition tools)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 1st interface service provides the link between the tools designed for
 creating and modifying workflow definitions and the workflow enactment
 service.
 It controls the system connection.
 In addition, it inquiries the workflow for process definitions and resource
 classifications.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Interface 2 (workflow client applications) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Through the 2nd interface service, users have access to a work list handler
 service and enactment services.
 In addition, the service produces states of cases and work items.
 The states are also controlled through this service (i.e.
 start, interruption, hang-up, executing, etc).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Interface 3 (invoked applications)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When some tasks of a process need to invoke an application outside of the
 workflow engine, they directly activate the workflow enactment service
 through the 3rd interface service and open interactive applications the
 current work item of the work list handler.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Interface 4 (other workflow enactment services)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interoperability and communication between workflows become the bottleneck
 to solve with the recommendations and standards of WfMC.
 The 4th interface service handles the basic operations to exchange between
 autonomous workflow systems.
 Through this interface, workflows transfer cases, resources and work items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Interface 5 (administration and monitoring tools)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 5th interface manages the administration and the monitoring tools of
 the workflow system.
 Through this service, the executing process should be managed, well-supervised
 and the events should be recorded in log files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Main Requirements on Scientific Workflow Management Systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Workflows in the scientific area make use of a data-centric approach.
 Typically, huge amounts of data have to be processed, e.g.
 5 GB data per day is transmitted by the Hubble telescope, and probably
 need to be processed by a workflow, this is why modeling language for scientifi
c workflows is primarily data-driven.
 That means, for accommodating the scientists’ needs the main focus of the
 modeling language should be on data flow while the control flow is considered
 secondary.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
usability
\series default
: since the majority of users of sWfMSs are no computer scientists.
 A scientist needs the support of easy-to-use tools, automation as far as
 possible and maximal flexibility in the usage of the sWfMS.This means that
 scientists want to:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
model their workflows in a convenient way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
run their workflows and store their data on resources that are specified
 by the user himself or automatically chosen by the sWfMS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
same support for services used in traditional workflows.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
flexible:
\series default
 it mean the ability of a system to react to changes in its environment.
 Approaches to flexibility of workflows can be divided into two groups:
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
workflow can be modified according to the changed situation (known as adaptation
).
 Such modifications can address different workflow dimensions (logical,
 functional, organizational dimension) and may be applied to workflow models
 or single workflow instances.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
workflow can be modeled in a way that avoids its modification even in the
 presence of a changing environment (known as avoid change).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
monitoring: 
\series default
WMS should support the ability to monitor the status of the workflow execution.
 For example, the scientist is interested in knowledge about running, finished
 or faulted activities, allocated resources, and the dynamical choice of
 a service implementation.
 Inspecting the produced data is also a need.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
reproducibility:
\series default
 is of utmost importance for different reasons.
 Scientists who are not involved in the execution of the workflow need to
 be able to retrace the simulation, have to review the findings, or need
 to use the results.
 The operating scientist may want to repeat a workflow or parts of it to
 draw conclusions, and to prove statements and assumptions.
 Additionally, the scientist may share the results with people he collaborates
 with.
 While following and reproducing workflow runs and their (intermediate)
 results scientists use provenance information.
 Finally, provenance information should be displayed in a way that (non-computer
) scientists understand the execution of workflows including the derivation
 of data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
robustness: 
\series default
it is an important issue since scientific workflows are long-running.
 The term robustness denotes the ability of being error- resistant.
 The needed flexibility mechanisms mentioned above are a way to improve
 the robustness of a system.
 But additional approaches are needed to protect the execution progress
 from being lost in case of unforeseeable failures, to reach a consistent
 system state even in the presence of failures, and to proceed a simulation/expe
riment after a failure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
scalability:
\series default
 scientific workflows should scale with the number of users, number of utilized
 services, data or calculation resources and involved participants.
 Today, typical scientific workflows are mostly executed in a central manner
 on a single machine.
 A decentralized workflow enactment can help to scale via distributed process
 execution.
 It can be achieved, for example, by parallel execution in distributed and
 heterogeneous execution environments using provisioning techniques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
specific requirements:
\series default
 there are specific requirements for each specific scientific domain, e.g.
 medical science, chemistry or mechanical engineering.
 Specific domain related requirements and the fact that it is hard to cover
 all scientific domains in one WMS create the need to extends WMSs and the
 workflow models and possibly adapt these models and their instances.
 This includes, for example, domain specific services, result displays or
 meta-models for semantic annotations.

Nowadays, cloud computing is an emerging technology due to virtualization
 and providing low price services on pay-as per-use basis and it is the

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous chapter, we have introduced the workflow technology.
 However the execution scientific workflows needs a huge amounts of data
 or allocate enormous computing resources and a big scalability, this is
 why we will present in this chapter the most convivial execution infrastructure
 which is the cloud computing model.

\begin_layout Subsection
Definition of Cloud Computing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The modern literature provides several definitions of Cloud Computing.
 Some definitions of Cloud Computing refer to services provided by data
 centre, while others define it as a service provided by the Internet.Still,
 the most quoted definition of Cloud Computing is the NIST definition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) which is an agency
 of the United States Department of Commerce whose mission is to promote
 American innovation and industrial competitiveness, define the cloud computing
 as following : 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand
 network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g.,
 networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly
 provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider
 interaction.

\begin_layout Standard
The National Institute of Standards and Technology's definition
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 of cloud computing identifies "five essential characteristics":
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
On-demand self-service
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consumers of cloud computing services, such as server time and network storage,
 as needed automatically nearly instant access to resources.
 To support this expectation, clouds must allow self-service access so that
 customers can request, customize, pay, and use services without intervention
 of human operators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Broad network access
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard
 mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms
 (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Resource pooling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers
 using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources
 dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.
 There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally
 has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources
 but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g.,
 country, state, or datacenter).
 Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, and network
 bandwidth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Rapid elasticity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cloud computing gives the illusion of unlimited computing resources available
 on demand in any quantity at any time.
 Therefore, users expect clouds to rapidly provide resources in any quantity
 at any time.
 In particular, it is expected that the additional resources can be (a)
 provisioned, possibly automatically, when an application load increases
 and (b) released when load decreases (scale up and down).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Measured service
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Services must be priced on a shortterm basis (e.g., by the hour), allowing
 users to release (and not pay for) resources as soon as they are not needed.
 For these reasons, clouds must implement features to allow efficient trading
 of service such as pricing, accounting, and billing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging
 a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type
 of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts).
 Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparen
cy for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Cloud Vulnerability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary challenge posed to data management in the cloud is content security.
 Due to the ease of access to content over the internet, concerns have been
 raised due to data vulnerability.
 In a review of cloud security issues, funded by IBM, 382 organizations
 disclosed cloud security issues in 2016 across 16 different industries.
 The security issues faced by cloud environments include; the miss-use of
 cloud content, malicious hacking, failure of vendor security and shared
 technology vulnerabilities.
 While improve cloud security is an area currently undergoing considerable
 research , and it was observed that the security of cloud content is vulnerable
 on several levels.
 On a "communications level" risk arises from the sharing of sensitive informati
on (e.g.
 access passwords).
 On a "security level" the cloud is vulnerable to password cracking, cookie
 poisoning and CAPTCHA breaking among other threats.
 Moreover, cloud content is subject to Service Level Agreements (SLAs) such
 as legal or confidentiality requirements which may compromise data security.
 Due to the multi-tiered vulnerability of cloud architecture, current innovation
s aiming to improve cloud security are unlikely to remove all levels of
 threat.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Technical Issues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although Cloud Computing offers improved efficiency by means of “on demand”
 content access, the cloud can also be prone to technical malfunctions such
 as outages.
 Even the most established cloud vendors do encounter unexpected technical
 problems despite generally having high standards of maintenance.It is estimated
 that cloud services are unavailable for 7.5 hours per year (99.9% reliability).
 While, at a glance, this figure may seem impressive, it does not reach
 the expected reliability quotient of 99.999% for sensitive data management.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Cost Creep 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At first glance migrating to a “pay-as-you-go” pricing model as employed
 by many cloud providers may seem financially attractive.
 However, it has been well documented that organizations that migrate to
 a cloud environment are often charged with additional hidden usage charges.
 Additional usage charge can accumulate to be a deterrent to cloud adoption,
 particularly for smaller enterprises.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Financial Risk in Disaster Scenarios
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cloud users can incur significant costs in cases of cloud outage, security
 breach or vendor lock-in (see below).
 According to the Penomen Institute, for example, in 2016, the average distribut
ed cost incurred by a datacenter outage was almost $750, 000.
 In the same year data breaches, depending on their nature, are estimated
 to have cost between around 130$ and 170$ to resolve per record.
 The cost in these scenarios may fall on either the cloud utilize or the
 cloud vendor, depending on the predefined contract between the two parties.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Vendor Lock-In
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vendor lock-in problem in cloud computing is characterized by expensive
 and time-consuming migration of application and data to alternative providers.
 Cloud software vendors lock in customers in several ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
by designing a system incompatible with software developed by other vendors

\begin_layout Itemize
by using proprietary standards or closed architectures that lack interoperabilit

?Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Large-scale complex scientific applications/workflow are executed and analyzed
 in the multi-disciplinary area of research such as astronomy and physics.
 The workflow contains a large number of mutually dependent tasks which
 are executed according to their dependency constraint.
 Due to dependency constraint, the child task can start its execution only
 when parent task finishes its execution.
 A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is used to represent workflows.
 These workflows often have disparate requirements (such as storage and
 CPU) and constraints (dependency) that need to be accounted during their
 execution

Definition of Task scheduling of scientific workflows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Task scheduling of scientific workflow is extremely important.
 Task scheduling algorithms is based on appropriate policies to deploy scientifi
c workflow to the physical nodes in the cloud computing system.
 Because various physical nodes are heterogeneous, and their running status
 are dynamic changed over time, at the same time, the system resources required
 by users and the request types of users are different, so that the design
 of the scheduling algorithms of scientific workflow is complex in the cloud
 computing system.
 A bad scheduling policy can lead to a decline in system performance, a
 long time span of request feedback, a decrease in user satisfaction, and
 a decrease in system throughput.
 In general, the goal of tasks scheduling of scientific workflow in the
 cloud environment is to optimize the allocation of scientific workflow,
 maximize user satisfaction, and maximize the economic benefits of operators,
 and minimize operating costs

Scientific workflow scheduling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Workflow scheduling calls for high computation and communication costs,
 especially scientific workflows that have to do with areas as astronomy
 and biology are among the most commonly used cloud applications.
 In cloud computing, a service provider provides users with various capacities
 at various costs.
 Usually, faster resources are more expensive than slower ones.
 Thus, the scheduler with varied resources for workflow will have different
 runtimes and costs; therefore, there will be various restrictions by the
 user.
 The time restriction guarantees that the workflow is done within the time
 specified by the user.
 The cost constraint guarantees that the cost does not exceed the budget
 established by the user.
 The optimal response will create a balance between these two criteria

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Offline scheduling which means the execution time is calculated, and mapping
 tasks shall be examined at pre-scheduled times.
 This scheduling approach is static.
 This strategy helps us prepare a supply plan for tasks, allocate resources
 to them, and then execute the tasks according to this supply plan
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "hard_optimization_mohammadzadeh2021energy"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.Static scheduling generates a scheduling plan (SP) that allocates all executable
 tasks to compute nodes before execution and the WMS strictly adheres to
 the scheduling plan throughout the duration of the scientific workflow
 execution.
 Since it is prior to execution, static scheduling generates little overhead
 during execution.
 It is efficient if the WMS can accurately predict the execution time of
 each task, when the execution environment varies little during workflow
 execution and when the WMS has sufficient information about the computing
 and storage capabilities of the corresponding computers.
 However, when the execution environment undergoes dynamic changes, it is
 very difficult to achieve load balance.
 Static task scheduling algorithms have two types of processor selection
 methods: 
\series bold
heuristic-based
\series default
 and 
\series bold
guided random search-based
\series default
.
 The heuristic-based method schedules tasks according to a predefined rule
 while the random search-based method schedules tasks randomly

\begin_layout Itemize
The second approach is online task scheduling, which means dynamic scheduling
 tasks, where one needs to use and consider available resources rather than
 operating time.
 The tasks will be performed without delay, using the available resources
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.Dynamic scheduling produces scheduling plans that distribute and allocate
 executable tasks to compute nodes during workflow execution.
 This type of scheduling is suitable for scientific workflows, in which
 the workload of tasks is difficult to estimate, or for environments where
 computer capabilities vary greatly during execution.
 It should be noted that dynamic scheduling requires time to dynamically
 generate scheduling plans during execution.
 Dynamic scheduling algorithms can be based on queueing techniques in a
 publish/subscribe model with different strategies such as First In First
 Out (FIFO), adaptive, etc

\begin_layout Paragraph
Cost
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The minimization of the execution cost or the respect of user-defined budget:
 for the user, reducing execution cost is of a capital importance.
 User sometimes have a cap on the amount of money spent on resources (i.e.
 budget).
 Minimizing execution cost and taking into account user-defined budget in
 a scheduling strategy is crucial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Makespan
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The minimization of the execution time or the respect of user-defined deadline
 as in the case of the execution cost, execution time and deadline are of
 a capital importance for cloud users.
 Therefore, scheduling strategies must strive to reducing the makespan while
 mapping workflow tasks on cloud resources and be aware of user-defined
 deadline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\begin_layout Paragraph
Maximization of VM utilization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
idle time slots in provisioned VMs are deemed as a waste of money as they
 were paid for but not utilized and as a result, algorithms try to avoid
 them in their schedules.
 Minimizing idle time slots and maximizing the utilization of resources
 helps reducing execution cost as well as energy consumption, engraving
 profit to providers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Energy Consumption

\begin_layout Standard
The current industries, organizations, and governments are really concern
 about the reduction of energy and to reduce the carbon footprint.
 For cloud computing providers, energy consumption reduction is a key to
 upgrade their return of investment (ROI).
 Energy efficient scheduling on the servers is one of the challenging problems
 in a dynamic environment such as cloud domain for reducing the energy consumpti
on.

Energy optimization problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scientific workflows are the constitution of distinct tasks with complex
 dependency.
 Resource provisioning and the order in which workflow tasks are executed
 are challenging problems.
 The inefficient utilization of resources while executing the workflows
 wastes a tremendous number of resources.
 The inefficient utilization of resources increases the number of unused
 provisioned resources.
 These unused resources increase energy consumption without performing any
 useful operation.
 The resource utilization can be increased by efficient resource provisioning.
 An energy efficient scheduling algorithm can be used to manage the resources
 that are required by the task while executing these scientific workflow
 tasks.
 In the literature, numerous workflow scheduling algorithms have been proposed.
 These scheduling algorithms focus on diminishing makespan and cost with
 inadequate resources.
 The selection and designing of a competent and operative workflow scheduling
 algorithm are also challenging tasks.
 The energy-aware scheduling algorithm must be selected which can provision
 a proper resource from the offered resources which are efficient enough
 to complete the workflow tasks within their deadline constriction, and
 it can decrease the energy consumption

Hard optimization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A multi-objective optimization approach is suggested here for scientific
 workflow task-scheduling problems in cloud computing.
 More frequently, scientific workflow involves a large number of tasks.
 It requires more resources to perform all these tasks.
 Such a large amount of computing power can be supported only by cloud infrastru
cture.
 To implement complex science applications, more computing energy is expended,
 so the use of cloud virtual machines in an energy-saving way is essential.
 However, even today, it is a difficult challenge to conduct a scientific
 workflow in an energy-aware cloud platform.
 The hardness of this problem increases even more with several contradictory
 goals.
 Most of the existing research does not consider the essential characteristic
 of cloud and significant issues, such as energy variation and throughput
 besides makespan and cost.

PBHGA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color brown
The Parallel bi-objective hybrid genetic algorithm (PBHGA) is a parallel
 evolutionary algorithm for solving multi-objective optimization problems.
 It combines several optimization techniques including genetic algorithm
 (GA) and local search.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color brown
The algorithm works by using an initial population of random solutions.
 Individuals in this population are rated based on their goals and their
 fitness is assessed using a fitness function.
 Then, individuals are selected for breeding using a rank-based or roulette
 selection operator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color brown
Reproduction is done using genetic operators such as mutation and crossover.
 Mutation involves modifying a single gene of the individual while crossbreeding
 involves creating new individuals by combining the characteristics of two
 different parents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color brown
The process of selection and reproduction is repeated for several generations
 until an optimal solution is found.
 During the whole optimization process, PBHGA maintains a population of
 solutions to efficiently explore the search space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color brown
The parallel approach of the algorithm helps to speed up the optimization
 process by running multiple search tasks simultaneously on different processors.
 It also makes it possible to efficiently explore regions of the search
 space that would otherwise be difficult to reach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color brown
Finally, the hybrid genetic algorithm uses local search techniques to improve
 the quality of solutions by applying perturbation operations to existing
 solutions.
 These perturbation operations are designed to slightly perturb existing
 solutions to bring them closer to an optimal solution.

 It aims to simultaneously minimize power consumption and execution time
 of multiple tasks with quality of service (QoS) constraints such as timeliness

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The MMF-DVFS algorithm uses an approach based on multi-objective optimization
 which seeks to find a compromise between the objectives of minimizing energy

EASLA (Efficient Antlion Optimizer with a Small Local Attraction) is a metaheuri

 The algorithm is used for solving various optimization problems, including
 function optimization and feature selection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color brown
The Improved EASLA algorithm is an enhanced version of EASLA, which incorporates
 some modifications to improve its performance.
 The key modifications include the incorporation of a mutation operator
 to explore the search space and the use of a dynamic population size to
 adapt to the search problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color brown
The basic idea behind EASLA is to simulate the hunting behavior of antlions,
 which use a combination of ambush and trap techniques to capture their
 prey.
 In EASLA, the antlion represents the best solution found so far, and the
 ants represent potential solutions in the search space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color brown
The algorithm starts by randomly generating a population of ants and placing
 them in the search space.
 The ants move toward the antlion based on a probability function that takes
 into account both the distance to the antlion and the local attraction
 of the area.
 The antlion is then updated to the best solution found among the ants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color brown
The Improved EASLA algorithm extends this basic framework by introducing
 a mutation operator that randomly modifies the position of some ants, which
 can help to explore new regions of the search space.
 The population size is also dynamically adjusted during the search to balance
 exploration and exploitation.
\end_layout

 The algorithm aims to find an optimal schedule that minimizes the energy
 consumption of the system while meeting the performance requirements.
 ECS uses a list scheduling approach to find a feasible schedule and then
 applies a genetic algorithm to optimize the schedule, ECS+Idle is an extension
 of ECS that exploits the idle time of processors to further reduce energy
 consumption.
 The algorithm schedules tasks in a way that allows processors to enter
 idle mode as much as possible without violating the performance requirements.
 ECS+Idle uses a greedy approach to find an initial schedule, and then applies
 a genetic algorithm to optimize the schedule by exploiting the idle time
 of processors.
 Both ECS and ECS+Idle have been shown to be effective in reducing energy
 consumption in computing systems while maintaining performance requirements.
 These algorithms have been applied to various scheduling problems, including
 task scheduling on heterogeneous systems, scheduling in cloud computing

VM allocation model

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reducing energy consumption in a cloud data center has recently become a
 major concern for many researchers.
 This is because the cloud environment has become a trusted platform that
 individuals, organizations, and the government rely on to conduct business.
 So, if the energy consumption in the cloud data center is not reduced,
 it will have a direct or indirect impact on all the stakeholders.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A VM allocation model has been proposed (see Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "VM_allocation_model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), which aims at managing cloud resources to reduce energy consumption in
 the cloud data center.
 In workflow scheduling, a scheduler is developed to assign the right tasks
 to the right VMs to improve the scheduling objectives.
 However, the biggest challenge is how to manage the cloud resources effectively
 to achieve the set goals.
 This is because cloud users turn in a large number of requests that require
 resources to schedule.
 This becomes even more obvious if these requests (tasks) are to be scheduled
 within certain deadlines.
 This challenge can be well managed if the scheduler is implemented with
 a well-defined resource management plan.

 These deadlines are set by users.
 A task can have a shorter/earliest deadline or a longer deadline.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A shorter/earliest deadline task is a task that is close to its specified
 scheduling time.
 Such tasks are assigned the highest priorities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tasks with long deadlines are tasks that do not require higher priority.
 This is because such tasks are not close to their predefined deadlines
 and therefore can be assigned to resources after the higher priority tasks
 (shorter deadline tasks) have been scheduled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, each task must be executed before the specified deadline.
 If the execution of a workflow task 𝑇 exceeds its deadline, it means that
 the deadline constraint set by the user has been violated.

 we have four workflow tasks that have arrived and are queued to be mapped
 to VMs.
 The arrived tasks are 𝑤𝑡1, 𝑤𝑡2, 𝑤𝑡3, and 𝑤𝑡4.
 We also have three types of VMs (𝑉𝑀
\begin_inset Formula $_{𝐻𝐸𝐶}$
\end_inset

, 𝑉𝑀
\begin_inset Formula $_{𝑀𝐸𝐶}$
\end_inset

, and 𝑉𝑀
\begin_inset Formula $_{𝐿𝐸𝐶}$
\end_inset

).
 These tasks have different deadlines, and we need to map them to VMs based
 on their deadlines.
 𝑤𝑡1 belongs to the HCT group because its deadline is 2 min, which is too
 tight, and if it is not allocated immediately, it might miss its deadline.
 To prevent 𝑤𝑡1 from missing its deadline, we quickly mapped it to VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{HEC}$
\end_inset

.
 The reason is that VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{HEC}$
\end_inset

 is a high-speed VM that can finish executing 𝑤𝑡1 before or on its deadline.
 The next task closer to its deadline is 𝑤𝑡4, and since VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{HEC}$
\end_inset

 is currently executing 𝑤𝑡1, we mapped 𝑤𝑡4 to VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{MEC}$
\end_inset

.
 The projections show that by the time 𝑤𝑡1 will meet its deadline, 𝑤𝑡3 will
 have 3 min left to also meet its deadline (5min-2 min).

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of workflow scheduling is to find the best optimal solution from
 various optimization methods that can give good results for the optimization
 problem.
 The optimization problem can be single objective or multi objective optimizatio
n problem.
 Single-objective optimization involves optimizing only one scheduling objective
, such as execution makespan or cost.
 Multi-objective optimization, on the other hand, focuses on optimizing
 two or more objectives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem of multi-objective optimization varies from user to user and
 must be managed accordingly.
 Some users may want a reduced execution makespan and execution cost while
 ensuring that QoS constraints are not violated, others may want to reduce
 energy consumption and task execution time while ensuring effective utilization
 of cloud resources.
 In this work, a multi-objective scheduling problem has been considered.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider a workflow application as DAG.
 It is modeled with data dependencies representing precedence constraints
 between tasks.
 These tasks represent requests from the users to be processed on cloud
 resources (VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{HEC}$
\end_inset

, (VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{MEC}$
\end_inset

, VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{LEC}$
\end_inset

) so that the energy consumption, makespan and execution cost are reduced
 without violating the deadlines of the tasks.
 However, reducing energy consumption increases the execution cost of scientific
 workflow applications.
 This is because energy consumption and execution cost are conflicting metrics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our goal is to reduce the energy consumption, makespan and execution cost
 of workflow tasks with dependency constraints.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In recent years, the vast energy consumption generated by cloud data centers
 has attracted wide attention from society.
 Relevant survey data show that electricity demand in US data centers has
 increased from 29 billion kWh in 2000 to nearly 73 billion kWh in 2020.
 The computing device will also increase the thermal load while using electric
 energy.
 The thermal load of a single rack will reach 50 kW in 2025.
 In addition, it also leads to the decline of quality of service (QoS) and
 environmental deterioration, which runs counter to the concept of green
 sustainable development.
 Therefore, achieving energy conservation and emission reduction is the
 key to developing the next generation of green data centers

\begin_layout Standard
EViMA focuses on improving resource management in the cloud data center
 to obtain the best task schedules that reduces energy consumption, execution
 makespan and execution cost without violating deadline constraints.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The EViMA algorithm is supported by 4 other algorithms, namely:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Highly Critical Workflow Task Selection Algorithm (HiCTSA)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Low Critical Task Selection Algorithm (LoCTSA)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
VM Power Regulating Algorithm (VM-PRA),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Slack Time Harvesting Algorithm (STiHA).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The algorithm takes as input a set of workflow tasks represented by wt =

 wtn) and a set of instances (VMs) represented by (VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{HEC}$
\end_inset

, VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{MEC}$
\end_inset

, and VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{LEC}$
\end_inset

).
 The ‘‘n’’ workflow tasks can be any type of task in a queue that requires
 resources for scheduling.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The algorithm starts by identifying the arrived tasks and computing their
 expected finishing times (EFT) to determine the task execution order.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Then, a task priority queue is created in which the tasks are arranged in
 three execution orders based on their critical times (HCT, MCT, and LCT).
 To determine the execution order of the tasks, their expected finishing
 times are calculated using Eq.(4).
 The tasks that are close to their deadline and need to be mapped to VMs
 at or before their deadline are given higher priority.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To generate cost-efficient and energy-optimized schedules, a VM assignment
 order is also introduced (Line 5).
 Once both the tasks execution order and VM assignment order is established,
 we employ EViMA to explore through the various workflow tasks to find the
 overall critical tasks (HCTs), (tasks that are approaching their deadline)
 from the ready queue and immediately assign them to a high speed procession
 VM (VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{HEC}$
\end_inset

).
 This is done to find high-quality solutions to the workflow scheduling
 problem.
 For example, if wti through the searching process is found to belong to
 the HCT queue, Algorithm

is called to assign it to a VM with high processing speed (VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{HEC}$

), as described in line 8.
 However, if the task belongs to the LCT group, Algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 is called to process it, as described in line 9.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
On the other hand, if the expected finishing time of the task is less than
 or equal to the harvested slack time of VMk, Algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is applied to schedule the task as in lines 15 and 16.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the expected end time is equal to the deadline, assign the task directly
 to VM

\end_inset

 as in lines 11 and 12.
 Otherwise, apply Algorithm

, solve the problem of which workflow tasks should be selected first and
 to which VM and ensure that all workflow tasks meet their deadlines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HiCTSA works at both the VM and task levels to ensure that tasks are selected
 and assigned to resources for execution to avoid delays.
 We consider a set of workflow tasks WT = (wt1, tw2, tw3..........wtn) in a workflow
 application.
 These tasks have different deadlines, and therefore users expect them to
 be executed before their deadlines.
 Also, these tasks require some resources to start the scheduling process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Algorithm 2 starts by checking the criticality of the tasks as in line 1.Then
 compares the expected finishing time of each workflow task in the ready
 queue (line 2).
 If the expected finishing time of workflow task wt1 approaches its deadline,
 this task is marked as an HCT task (line 4).
 A mapping is then created for all HCT (line 5).
 However, if two or more tasks have the same deadline, another high speed
 VM is deployed to map those tasks (line 7 and 8).

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The first phase is the task identification and grouping phase, in which
 less critical tasks are identified and queued for execution.
 In the first phase, the algorithm compares the expected finishing time
 of each workflow task with its deadline.
 If a task’s EFT is greater than its deadline, the task is moved to a new
 queue called the LCT queue (lines 1, 2, and 3).
 This is done to avoid mapping less critical tasks to HEC VM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The second phase is the VM allocation phase.
 In the second phase, the quality of the solution is improved by ensuring
 that all less critical tasks are assigned to VMs with lower processing
 speed (VMs with lower cost and lower energy consumption) instead of assigning
 them to VMs with higher execution cost.
 This is done to reduce the cost of running workflow tasks.

VM power regulating algorithm (VM-PRA)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
VM-PRA (see Algorithm 4) check the status of all VMs used to execute workflow
 tasks.
 Sometimes,underutilized VMs are not shut down, which can increase the power
 consumption of a data center.VM-PRA overcomes this drawback by introducing
 Idle ‘‘off’’ Busy ‘‘on’’ techniques that identify the status of all VMs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method starts by defining the status of all VMs that are used for workflow
 tasks execution.
 The VMs are divided into two stages, namely a busy stage and an idle stage.
 A VM is said to be busy when it is currently executing or processing a
 workflow task.
 Idle VMs, on the other hand, are VMs that have not yet been assigned any
 job or have completed the execution process and are waiting for more jobs
 to be executed.
 The algorithm checks, if there are some idle VMs, and if so, it switches
 all idle VMs to the memory state.
 For example, when VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{HEC}$
\end_inset

 and VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{LEC}$
\end_inset

 are running and VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{MEC}$
\end_inset

is idle, the VM-PRA algorithm quickly switches VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{MEC}$
\end_inset

 into power saving mode to save some energy.
 In reality, VMs do not consume power, but when the VM is powered off or
 put into power saving mode, it reduces the power consumption of its PM,
 and hence a reduction in data center power consumption.

Slack time harvesting method (STiHaM)

\begin_layout Standard
Slack time is a time interval that occurs when a particular task completes
 its execution before its actual scheduled completion time.
 In other words, it is a time difference between a task’s scheduled completion
 time and its actual completion time.
 The slack time is used to accumulate the slack times for each VM type in
 the VM pool as in line 5 of Algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Information and communications technology equipment (ICT) and cooling equipment
 consume most of the energy in the data centers.
 The server is the most critical ICT equipment.
 In most cases, the average CPU utilization rate of the server is only 15%
 to 20%, and there are a large number of servers in an idle state which
 consumes much energy.Therefore, VMs can be relocated into as few physical
 machines (PM) as possible through VM consolidation technology, and the
 low-load PM can be switched off.
 No-load PM can be switched to a sleep state to reduce the number of PMs
 during activities and avoid energy waste

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, the problem of low server utilization is appearing by narrow
 dynamic power ranges of servers: even completely idle servers still consume
 about 70% of their peak power.
 Therefore, keeping servers underutilized is highly inefficient from the
 energy consumption perspective.

Proposed approach

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective of our project is to provide a workflow scheduling mechanism
 in Cloud Computing.
 We propose an approach that consists of managing the available resources
 within a Cloud Computing system in the most efficient way possible and
 properly assigning tasks to virtual machines in order to minimize cost,
 makespan and energy without violating the deadline constraints established
 for each task by the user, in order to satisfy QoS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, this approach consider the following metrics and constraint:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Energy consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cost
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Maskespan
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Principle and description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our proposed approach is a version of the EViMA algorithm with the addition
 of a VM placement algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We suggest doing workflow partitioning and grouping tasks in same partition
 as just one task, this can reduce the scheduling time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We suggest starting the EViMA algorithm first for scheduling scientific
 workflows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\color brown
We think that when the PM is under-loaded or overloaded, it will consume
 more energy this why we think that if we apply and during execution we
 apply one (or more) virtual machine migration strategy(s) as in this article
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

,may be we will avoid this 2 cases and so reducing energy consumed by PM.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a workflowsim simulator, we have simulated the proposed approach.
 We compared the outcomes of 
\color brown
four separate scientific workflows
\color inherit
 with the improved EViMA algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Workflows 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use four different types of benchmark workflows (Montage, Cybershake,
 LIGO, and Epigenomics, Sipht) available on the Pegasus website.
 These workflows typically involve complex data of various sizes and complicated
 computer simulations.
 They need high computation power, and the availability of large infrastructures
 that cloud computing environments provide with different quality of service
 levels.
 The quality of schedules obtained by various algorithms is also compared
 using these workflows.
 Information about the task dependencies, the amount of data transmitted,
 and the execution time estimates are presented in DAX format.
 DAX files include a single time estimate for each task.
 To simulate the case of different time constraints provided by users, start
 time, and a deadline for each workflow are randomly assigned 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of these workflow types has four different workloads.
 For example, the Cybershake workflow has four workloads, including 30,
 50, 100, and 1000 tasks
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.Scheduling workflows are classified into two kinds of balanced and unbalanced
 .A balanced workflow has some pipelines that need similar services.
 Nevertheless, they process various types of services.
 The unbalanced workflow is more complicated and has many parallel tasks
 that involve many services

Simulation tool: WorkflowSim
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over the past few years, cloud computing has gained tremendous popularity
 since it presents a flexible and efficient solution for many services by
 Internet .
 Cloud is a large and complex system since it is composed of several users,
 service providers,physical machines, service broker, task scheduling algorithms
 , bandwidth, internet latency, and storage technology etc.
 On the other hands, all cloud-based implementations need various configurations.
 Therefore, it is very difficult for researchers to evaluate the performance
 of their policies in a real cloud environment
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a result, the simulator can play an important role in reducing cost,
 efficiency,infrastructure complexity, and security risks before a solution
 can be deployed on real infrastructure.
 By focusing on issues related to the quality of a particular component
 under various scenarios, cloud simulators enable performance analysts to
 monitor the behaviors of the system

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Description and main features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WorkflowSim was introduced for modeling Scientific Workflows in cloud environmen
t.
 Workflows in heterogeneous distributed systems show different levels of
 overheads that are explained based on computational operations and miscellaneou
s works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of simulators such as CloudSim do not consider fine granularity simulations
 of workflows and task clustering.
 Task clustering reduces the number of jobs to be executed and so execution
 overhead is decreased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, a job may have high risk for suffering from failures since it
 consists of several tasks.
 Researchers with WorkflowSim can study the impact of job failures runtime
 performance of workflows for different clustering methods.

\begin_layout Standard
WorkflowSim has many advantages
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 which are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It supports a stack of workflow parser and workflow engine delay to workflow
 optimization techniques with better accuracy are implemented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It implements several workflow-scheduling methods such as HEFT, Min-Min,
 and Max-Min and so developers can compare their algorithms with them in
 a simple way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It considers task clustering and layered overhead to the workflow simulation.
 Therefore, developers can test various strategies based on a real trace
 of overheads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It models failures for two layers (i.e., task/job) by an interface and hence
 developers can design fault-tolerant techniques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Limitations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WorkflowSim has some limitations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 such as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It includes limited types of failures.
 Therefore, developers cannot simulate the situation when a task is not
 successfully sent due to network problems or workflow scheduler issues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It does not consider the performance characteristic of file I/O.
 Therefore, developers cannot obtain suitable simulation for data-intensive
 applications since these applications involve reading or writing huge data
 files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It supports only simple workflow techniques and so developers cannot use
 other important approaches like workflow partitioning in their implementations.
